# Bukkit-Plugin-Id-Inverter
This is a plugin which is useful for changing your item's ID without changing thier NBT-tag or anything else like that.
It hasn't been completed yet, and it's my first plugin. I'd be appreciate if anyone gives me suggestions.

Minecraft Version: 1.12

commands:
/inverter add [target ID] [formula name]
# create a formula which changes currently the ID of the kind of the item in your main hand to the target ID.
/inverter remove [formula name]
# remove a formula
/inverter list
# show all formulae
/inverter detail
# especially show one formula in detail
/inverter enable [player] [formula name]
# enable the formula for the player
/inverter diable [player] [formula name]
# disable the formula for the player
